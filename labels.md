Use labels sparingly. Labels (a.k.a. pills) draw a user's attention so they should only be used to highlight things that are new or important.

#### Guidelines
- Use [labels][label-reference] to draw attention to content.

<h4 class="ui header"><div class="ui blue label">NEW</div>&nbsp; Track all the publications associated with your core</h4>

- Use labels as tokens for tagging things, like email contacts, usually not displaying more thant a ten to twelve items.
