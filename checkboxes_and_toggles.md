Checkboxes and toggles are used for options.

#### Guidelines

- Use the checkbox for multi-select list situations.
- Use the toggle boolean settings. On/off, true/false, public/private.
- Avoid using the radio button for a single option.
- Positive or on should be green. Negative or off should be grey. There are few exceptions.
- Place the label on the right hand side.
- Labels could be full sentences or incomplete sentence.
- Add text to the toggle clarifying that is “On” or “Off”.
- Label things in the affirmative. For example:
  - **Do not hide banner message (UNCLEAR)**
  - **Hide banner message (CLEARER)**

  - **Show banner message (CLEAR)**
- Never include question marks in labels. For example:
  - "**Turn on airplane mode?**" vs. "**Airplane Mode**"
  - "**Activate Tax Feature?**" vs. "**Tax Features**"
